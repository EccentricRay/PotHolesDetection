# YOLO dataset configuration for the MWPD (Multi-Weather
# Pothole Detection) dataset.
#
# This file tells YOLO where your images/labels are and
# what classes to detect. We only have 1 class: "pothole".
#
# The 'path' field gets auto-updated by the training script
# after the dataset is downloaded, so you don't need to
# change it manually.
# ============================================================

# Root path to the dataset (auto-updated by train.py)
path: ./data/MWPD

# Relative paths to image folders (from 'path' above)
train: train/images
val: valid/images
test: test/images

# Number of classes
nc: 1

# Class names (index 0 = pothole)
